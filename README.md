# :postbox: Faq

**Question:** What are the technologies used in this project?

**Answer:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

**Question** Why Next.js instead of other frameworks of React out there?

**Answer** I chose Next.js because it has a hybrid architecture. This website has only one page and it's [statically generated](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) by fetching data from a headless [CMS](https://github.com/LauraBeatris/floripamais-strapi-api).
